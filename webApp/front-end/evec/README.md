First move the front-end project directory
`cd` `evec-mini-demo/webApp/front-end/evec`

Install required dependencies

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

Currently, we haven't implemented any display or good-looking UI, so you have to turn on the browser console to check the return data.

To turn on the console, in Google Chrome, you can right click, and select 'Inspect'


THe demo still needs a lot of front end work, so please bear with us if you are a UX person ;-) Contact us, we may hire you to work together for a better UI for our official product ;))))
